Bachelor's Project
======
**Subject:** 
Probabilistic K-Center Problem

**Location:**
Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran

**Description:**
I am currently doing by Bachelorâ€™s project on the Probabilistic K-Center problem. In this variant of the famous K-Center probelm, each client has a probability distribution over different locations rather than a deterministic single location. The objectivel is to allocate each client to a center as well as decide which k centers to open. The ultimate goal is to minimize the expected value of the K-center objective function across all possible realizations. We aim to improve upon the previous approximation factors for this problem by using LP rounding techniques. I will put the results for this research on here as soon as they are avaiable.

Summer Research Program
======
**Subject:** 
Relative Fractional Independence Number and Its Applications

**Mentor:**
[Professor. Amin (Aminzadeh) Gohari](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/gohari-amin/)

**Location:**
Institute for Theoretical Computer Science and Communications, Chinese University of Hong Kong

**Description:**
I am currently engaged in research on the concept of relative fractional independence numbers and their practical implications in approximating the Shannon capacity of graphs. I have developed methods for computing this number within specific graph families. This work is still **ongoing**, and I am continually exploring new avenues in this exciting field of study. You can find my current results [in here](/files/Relative_Fractional_Packing_Number_and_Its_Properties.pdf).

Combinatorial Optimization Research Project
======
**Subject:** 
Densest Subgraph Problem

**Teammate(s):**
Mohammad Amin Raeisi

**Description:**
We explored various algorithms to solve this problem, including Goldberg's Algorithms, Charikar's LP, Greedy Peeling algorithm, and the recently introduced Iterative Greedy Peeling algorithm. We strived to implement these algorithms efficiently and conducted a computational study on each of them. Based on our findings, we formulated different conjectures about this problem. You can find the results of our project in English [in here](/files/Densest_Subgraph_Problem.pdf).
