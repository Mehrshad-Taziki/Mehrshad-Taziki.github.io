Combinatorial Optimization Research Project
======
**Subject:** 
Densest Subgraph Problem

**Teammate(s):**
Mohammad Amin Raeisi

**Description:**
We explored various algorithms to solve this problem, including Goldburg's Algorithms, Charikar's LP, Greedy Peeling algorithm, and the recently introduced Iterative Greedy Peeling algorithm. We strived to implement these algorithms efficiently and conducted a computational study on each of them. Based on our findings, we formulated different conjectures about this problem.
