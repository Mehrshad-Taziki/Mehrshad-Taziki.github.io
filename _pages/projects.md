Summer Research Program
======
**Subject:** 
Relative Fractional Independence Number and It's Applications

**Mentor:**
[Professor. Amin (Aminzadeh) Gohari](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/gohari-amin/)

**Location:**
Institute for Theoretical Computer Science and Communications, Chinese University of Hong Kong

**Description:**
I am currently engaged in research on the concept of relative fractional independence numbers and their practical implications in approximating the Shannon capacity of graphs. I have developed methods for computing this number within specific graph families. This work is still **ongoing**, and I am continually exploring new avenues in this exciting field of study.

Combinatorial Optimization Research Project
======
**Subject:** 
Densest Subgraph Problem

**Teammate(s):**
Mohammad Amin Raeisi

**Description:**
We explored various algorithms to solve this problem, including Goldburg's Algorithms, Charikar's LP, Greedy Peeling algorithm, and the recently introduced Iterative Greedy Peeling algorithm. We strived to implement these algorithms efficiently and conducted a computational study on each of them. Based on our findings, we formulated different conjectures about this problem. You can find the report of our project in English [in here](/files/Densest_Subgraph_Problem.pdf) you can also find the Persian version [in here](/files/DSP.pdf).
