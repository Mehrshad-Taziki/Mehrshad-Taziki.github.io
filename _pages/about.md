I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student in Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology, and I'm planning to start my graduate studies in the Fall of 2024.

I am generally intrested in Theoretical Computer Science. my main areas of intrest include,

*  Combinatorial Optimization
*  Approximation Algorithms
*  Algorithmic Graph Theory
*  Theory of Computation

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking, and experimenting with various coffee creations.
