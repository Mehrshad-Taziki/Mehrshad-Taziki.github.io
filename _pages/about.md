I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology. I plan to begin my graduate studies in the Fall of 2024.

I have a strong passion for Theoretical Computer Science, with particular interests in the following areas:

* Combinatorial Optimization
* Approximation Algorithms
* Algorithmic Graph Theory
* Theory of Computation

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking and experimenting with various coffee creations.
